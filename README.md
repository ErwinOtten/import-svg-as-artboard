# Import SVG as Artboards

Sketch imports SVG as a Group, but it doesn't support groups that do not fit its content.
So if you would have an SVG of 100px\*100px with a single centered circle inside of 20px radius, Sketch will create a Group of 40px\*40px with a Circle inside.

This plugin allows you to import SVG as Artboards instead, so that the offset is preserved.

## Installation

- [Download](./releases/download/latest/import-svg-as-artboard.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on import-svg-as-artboard.sketchplugin

## Development Guide

_This plugin was created using `skpm`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [skpm Readme](https://github.com/skpm/skpm/blob/master/README.md)._

### Usage

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch for changes:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Additionally, if you wish to run the plugin every time it is built:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Custom Configuration

#### Babel

To customize Babel, you have two options:

- You may create a [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc) file in your project's root directory. Any settings you define here will overwrite matching config-keys within skpm preset. For example, if you pass a "presets" object, it will replace & reset all Babel presets that skpm defaults to.

- If you'd like to modify or add to the existing Babel config, you must use a `webpack.skpm.config.js` file. Visit the [Webpack](#webpack) section for more info.

#### Webpack

To customize webpack create `webpack.skpm.config.js` file which exports function that will change webpack's config.

```js
/**
 * Function that mutates original webpack config.
 * Supports asynchronous changes when promise is returned.
 *
 * @param {object} config - original webpack config.
 * @param {boolean} isPluginCommand - whether the config is for a plugin command or a resource
 **/
module.exports = function(config, isPluginCommand) {
  /** you can change config here **/
};
```

### Debugging

To view the output of your `console.log`, you have a few different options:

- Use the [`sketch-dev-tools`](https://github.com/skpm/sketch-dev-tools)
- Run `skpm log` in your Terminal, with the optional `-f` argument (`skpm log -f`) which causes `skpm log` to not stop when the end of logs is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input
